            <p>Just stop planes is a non-profit organization that aims to stop planes from flying. We believe that planes are the main cause of global warming and we want to stop them from flying. We are a group of people who are passionate about the environment and we want to make a change. We are not funded by any government or organization. We are funded by people like you who want to make a change. If you want to help us, please donate to our cause.</p>
