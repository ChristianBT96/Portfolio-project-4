            <p>Every month, an atrocious amount of birds are killed due to our own selfish wants for travel. These innocents creatures are having their lives robbed from them due to us having conquered their domain. Sometimes, however, we are forced to travel.
                When Doctors Without Borders are travelling to aid in humanitarian crises, or when firefighters from all around the globe are travelling to help with forest fires, there are times where we as humans have to take to the skies.
                But that doesn't mean that we can't also limit our travel, for the sake of our winged friends. On the chart to the right, we can see how many birds are killed per month due to airplane-travel. We ask of you, we implore you, to think of the birds.
                If it is possible to limit your air-travel to months where most of our birds have migrated, we can limit, and hopefully reduce, the amount of birds that are killed each month. </p>

    <h2>Feathered Collisions: Bird Species and Total Hits in the Sky</h2>

    <p>
        Up in the sky, a sad story is happening. Birds, our sky buddies, are getting hurt by airplanes. It's not just a few; it's at least <b>86 species of animals being killed</b>, and maybe more. Some birds get so torn apart, such that we can't even tell what kind they were before getting slaughtered.
        <br><br>
        Look at the chart below. Each bar isn't just a number; it's a bird's life, cut short while flying. This isn't about vegan stuff or climate talk — it's about feeling for our flying friends. <b>The sky used to be a safe place for birds, but now, it's like a war zone</b>.
    </p>

        </div>

        <div class="right">
            <p>
                This isn't just another meaningless chart. It's proof we need to change, a request to care more, and a reminder that progress shouldn't hurt the ones who share the sky with us. <b>The birds may be quiet now, but their story speaks loudly</b> — asking us to think twice about how we travel through their home in the sky.
                <br><br>
                <b>Who's to blame?</b> Surprisingly, it's the companies that fly us around. They're supposed to be cool inventions, but they're also causing harm to nature. Our fast and easy flights shouldn't mean sadness for the birds.

    <h2>Map chart? → location & species overview</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Comprising over 1000 markers, each representing a collision, the map vividly portrays the encounters between airplanes and unsuspecting wildlife. The markers provide a description of the collision, including the species of the animal (if known), the airport at which it happened, and lastly, the height of the collision. When looking at the map, you will also notice a darker shadow at some of the markers. This is an indication of the frequency of collisions; the darker the shadow, the higher the frequency.
                <br><br>
                As can be seen from the map below, bird strikes are a major problem not only in the contiguous United States but also in the territories. Every state bears witness to the avian crisis, sparing none from the widespread impact of airborne tragedy. While these statistics focus solely on the US, envision a global map adorned with markers, each representing a life lost in the clash between creatures of the sky or ground and human-made flying machines. Imagine a world map drowning in shadows, making it impossible to discern the unfortunate victims, with marker shadows plunging into an abyss of darkness.</p>
